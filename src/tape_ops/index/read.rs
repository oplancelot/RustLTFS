//! LTFS Index Reading Operations
//!
//! This module provides functionality for reading LTFS index from tape,
//! including support for both single-partition and dual-partition tapes.
//!
//! Future implementation will include:
//! - read_index_from_tape: Main entry point for index reading
//! - validate_and_process_index: XML validation and parsing
//! - try_read_latest_index_from_eod: EOD-based index reading
//! - read_to_file_mark_with_temp_file: File mark-based reading
//! - And other helper functions currently in read_operations.rs

// This module is prepared for future index reading implementations
// Methods will be moved from read_operations.rs incrementally
